# **Domain of Interest**

Why are you interested in this field/domain?  

    We are interested in this domain because with living in Seattle, this city is primarily known for its rise in housing market costs. Due to the booming housing market, it has made it incredibly difficult for homebuyers to find a place. As college students, we have experienced how the uptick in costs has affected our options with living away from home and finding affordable housing in the U-District area.
